# automaticPlantSystem

These are my files for my automatic plant growing system. The Plant Growing System, or PGS is a durable and reliable machine that can grow crops and flowers optimally and automatically.

I made this because I like growing flowers and vegetables but I can't reliably give the plant the best amounts of water and types of light it needs to grow the best it can. Also, human error can contribute to the downfall of a plant. I'm very excited for this to fully come to life so I can enjoy freshly grown radishes and fennel in my room.
